#timezone conversion extension for chrome
A really poorly documented (read: basically not at all), project to pass the time and improve my life. 
The basic idea is to create an extension for chrome which will, at the click of a button, convert any highlighted text (including in the hard to access elements on a page such as inputs and textareas) into or from a designated timezone. Right now, it will only convert INTO Paris Timezone, UTC+1. 

timeonthefly.js is basically the brunt of my work, while timecodes.js is a bit of a dictionary.

See http://cborchert.com/timezone/sample.html for an example of it in the works. You are able to install it locally (it has the correct file structure for a chrome extension), but it's not very useful yet.
